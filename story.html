		1. Creator of the Supermodel Phenomenon</h2>
		 <p> Renowned photographer Peter Lindbergh, whose cinematic and lively images defined the era, died on September 3, 2019. The news was confirmed by his agent directly on Vogue and made public on his official Instagram account on September 4. He was 74. Over a career spanning over four decades, Lindbergh has photographed the world's leading celebrities. Lindbergh prefers projects that don't require him to retouch - a revolutionary step in the era of Photoshop and filters. Meghan Markle stated that she really enjoyed working with the German photographer during the 2017 Vanity Fair cover because she will finally see her freckles. "I don't care about being truthful," Lindbergh told The Sunday Times in 2017, "it's just the only thing that interests me."</p>
